      <p>
        For Project 8, we were given the task of creating an "experimental camera." This camera we create should
        alter the image seen by the user's webcam.
        For my "camera," I used the CLM tracking library in p5.js to track various facial features, and draw the
        corresponging emojis over the view. An "emoji camera."

    <p>
   At first after watching the tutorials, I wasn't sure what kind of "filter" I could make in p5. The pointilist thing Xin
      made was cool, but it took a while to generate a full image, so using it to recreate the webcam image would be hard, because you would
      need to stay still in the frame to match the original to the recreation.
      In Lab class, we did a live demo of CLM face tracking, and I figured I would use this method for my camera. 
      With this tool I could pick specific points on the face to draw images or shapes.
      In class, I made an example that replaces eyes with buttons, like in the movie Coraline. 
      This method could be used for a bunch of different points on the face.
      While I was texting, I came up with the idea to use emojis to recreate facial features.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
  A lot of people use emojis every day, including myself. Their use often removes a lot of the meaning behind a message for the sake of speed.
        Why should I text "that video made me laugh and I thought it was very funny," when I could send a few laughing emojis?
        The same idea takes form in this "camera." Why send a nice picture of someones face, when you could send some emojis?
