        For Project 2, we were told to create a program that creates a face in
        different sizes and shapes. It had to use variables created by us, as
        well as random values and either a mouse press or a button press. These
        elements introduced some interactivity into the mix,

        The first step was to sketch a face out:

<p>
  In photoshop, I drew some triangles with eyes and a mouth. That part was simple.
  Figuring out how to code this triangle into something random every time seemed challenging.
  
  To get the desired look, I created variables for the corners of the triangle, every X and Y point was
  a custom variable. These points were set to be random within a certain range, so the triangle will
  always be the same general shape. The eyes and mouth are always in the same position relative to the corners of the triangle,
  but their sizes change every refresh. The color of the triangle, as well as the size and shape of the mouth change too.

       It was cool to have some interactivity in my code. It is just a simple button press, but while creating my code I was playing
        around with the mouseX and mouseY values, drawing shapes that follow your mouse was a fun little activity. I sat there for a few minutes 
        moving a little triangle around my screen. I am excited to see what is next in terms of interactiveness in my code projects.
