        For Project 7, we were tasked with creating a game based on our own life and experiences. The game needed 3 parts or "scenes", and a controllable object
        that interacts with other objects on the screen

   Every week day of my life this semester is pretty similar in how it begins. I pack my bag with the stuff I need, head to the train, and commute into the city for class.
      I figure this process would be the autobiographical aspect of my game, plus it was already 3 different parts, so I could make 3 scenes out of it.
      For the first "scene" where I would pack my bag, the idea was that several objects would float around the screen, like a laptop, wallet, mask, general items
      that would be brought to school for the day.

      After all the items are "packed," the next scene begins where I ride to the train station on my scooter avoiding obstacles along the way. Obstacles like potholes, cars, and trees.
      After some time passes, the next "scene" would be finding a seat on the train once you make it to the station.

I wish I could say that the coding went smoothly. It was hard to balance this project with the other ones from my other classes, so it was very tedious. My game is still split between different sketches
      I understood the relationships between objects but was having lots of trouble when it came to the image assets and using them as objects within p5.js.

  SAt first I had the "objects" for the first scene displaying, but not at diffrent locations because they were being created within a for loop. After that< i used the method Xin told in the tutorial for using multiple
  images with one object, but it was giving me the error pictured above whenever I tried to run it, and I could not find a solution.
  The 2nd part was easier since there were not a bunch of images to display, the object could just be drawn multiple times this time.
