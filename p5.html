      <p>
        For Project 5, we were tasked with exploring patterns prevalent in cour cultures historically. We would take aspects of this pattern, and attempt
        to turn it into a sort of optical illusion using code.

    <p>
      My family is Greek, and the only pattern that comes to mind is the "key pattern"/meander:
      <img src = "https://cdn.glitch.me/5da19b71-a5bc-45aa-954d-a42f9b59d932%2F6d13d6f6-f26b-4d96-b4f7-2310d3dd8790.image.png?v=1633482523285"</img>
      It is comprised of a single, continious line and a repeating pattern. How I would turn this into an optical illusion, I honestly had no clue.
      The only thing I could think of was rotating a grid of these lines, so every 90 degrees the line matches up and the pattern continues.
      
      
    </p>
      <h1>
        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
      My code is comprised of a for loop that draws a grid of images. 
        <img src= "https://cdn.glitch.me/5da19b71-a5bc-45aa-954d-a42f9b59d932%2Fkey.png?v=1633483969660" </img>
        The image was made to look like it is one continuoius line, instead of a grid of different shapes.
        The intention was for each image on the grid to rotate about it's center, every 90 degrees, the pattern would reappear once the shapes lined up again.
        I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the inmages to rotate based on their center. I tried translating, translating with push and pop, even translating inside
        the for loop, but no matter what I could not get the intended effect.
        For now, I have it set so the images rotate about the regular origin of the sketch.
        There is no translate function currently because I could not figure it out.
