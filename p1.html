        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        For project 1, we were told to think of an object we have lost in the past.
        We had to descrie this object in plain text, share this explanation to a partner,
        then our partner would code the object using the description in p5.js.
        My partner was Maria Muste, and the objest she lost in the past is a fountain pen. The description she gave me was:
        <b>Black and silver, rectangle-shaped until the middle, where the cap ends. 
          From there, the body is slightly curved, forming an oval-like shape. 
          The pen is black with silver accents and those can be seen as thin lines across the middle, 
          right where the cap ends, on the bottom and top of the pen, having both circles that are parallel 
          to the ground silver and a silver line that continues from the parallel to the perpendicular. 
          The cap is black and has no curve, as mentioned previously. 
          The clip on the cap is silver as well and is slightly bombed, 
          very thin with a long rectangle shape. The clip ends where the cap ends.
          Parallel to the end of the cap, the clip has an almost 90-degree angle and the rectangle continues 
          in the same size and almost touches the pen; such engineering choice has been done for grip.</b>

      </p>

      <p>
       Based on the given description, it was pretty easy to construct this object out of 2D primitives. The object has 2 colors:
        Black and silver. It also has 2 main pieces, a long rectangular cap and an oval- like body that is flat at the bottom.
        The silver pieces are at either end and in the middle where the cap meets the body. At the top is also a clip that runs down the
        side of the cap. 
      </p>

        This project was a cool way to see how code could be used in art. The finished code definitely looks like a pen.
        It is made up of 8 total shapes, 4 rectangles and 4 ellipses. One rectangle is hidden at the bottom by being set the same color as the background.
        It covers up 2 ellipses to make the bottom of the object flat.
        The clip is rotated 3 degrees to angle it towards the object
        I have used a similar code called processing to make simple games a few years ago, and I am excited to see what else could be done in p5 now a few years later. The work is tedious in the moment, but seeing the
        finished shape on screen was satisfying and rewarding in the end.
