      <p>
        For Project 6, we were tasked with choosing something that we do in our everyday lives in order to visualize it. The thing that I chose to track
        whenever I would drink water, as well as when I would run out of water and the form I would replenish it in.
      </p>

      </h1>
    <p>
     I began tracking my data by writing down the time whenever I would drink water. 
      Whenever I finished the water bottle I was currently drinking, I would also mark that.

I only drank from two types of water bottles, my purple Brita filter water bottle, and plastic single use bottles. Depending if I was at school or home,
I would use different vessels for water storage and consumption

      <p>
    The code did not work exactly the way I wanted it to. I was having trouble having different images come up in the for() loop.
        I made an array for each day containing a list of each kind of water bottle I finished. I tried to make the image in the loop be based on the array,
        but it was giving an error saying that it was not the right data type. I think the image names in my array were not actually images, just text. 
        So it would not get assigned to an image if I set it.

        My data was pretty consistent with the bottle type thankfully, so I just set the image to the bottle with out pulling from the array.
