      <p>
        For Project 4, we were assigned to draw a figure on a template. The figure could be anything, as long as it was easy to break down into 3 body parts, the head, the body, and the legs.
We would then get grouped up with people in class to exchange parts of our figures with, then we would combine out figures into one.

        My drawing is shown:</p>

     It is a figure with the head of a frog. He is wearing a cool vest and purple shirt, and has the legs of Big Bird.
         My partners were Cassy Canuck and Maya Rodic.</P>
<p>
  Cassy drew a snake with 2 tails, wings, and a cool hat.</P>

      I combined the 3 figures into a hybrid frog/snake/robot. It is my frog's head, with the body of Cassy's snake, and the legs of Maya's robot.
        The wings of the snake flap, and the color of the moving part of the robot legs change color when the mouse gets clicked.
