        For Project 3, we were told to think about different ways of tracking time, and create a "clock" that visualizes our chosen method. It just could
        not show the traditional hours, minutes, and seconds. I created a due date clock, as the inputted due date gets closer, the pulse of the heart increases and the background
        color changes based on how much time is left.

<p>
We first started out with ideas of time. Some ideas of tracking time I had were tracking the amount of music we listen to, or the amount of steps
  taken/miles traveled in a day. Amount of work done, amount of people seen/ interacted with, time until due date, among a few others.
  All of those seemed hard to visualize except the due date one, this one also resonated with me more.
  As a student a lot of my schedule is based around school and when I have to turn in projects. Due dates hae a hold on my life and cause some anxiety sometimes.
  Anxiety could be represented through a heartbeat or pulse, and this pulse could change based on how close the current date and time is to the given due date.

      <p>
       This project was a fun way to experiment with booleans and logic. Setting a value based off of another value for the time was confusiong
        at first, and extracting the user inputs was a little hard to figure out. Once I had that figured out I just had to figure out the logic, which was tedious.
        All the different else if() statements had to not conflict with each other so the whole thing could work.
